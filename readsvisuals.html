						Reebox highlights designer Nicole McLaughlin<br />
						as an "extreme creative" in this tutorial to up-<br />
						cycling. McLaughlin's journey as an artist<br />
						begins with her finding work as a graphic de-<br />

						speaking on panels globally. She speaks on<br />
						her opportunities and how she combined her<br />

						Chicago artist, Doso, releases the music video for<br />
						You're Not That Fly - track 3 from Opus Two<br />
						album. The visual features him and the band<br />
						playing at the top of a roof top in the south side<br />
						of Chicago in one part, and then later in a dark,<br />
						smoky, industrial setting. The visual fairly reflects<br />
						Doso's diverse style in fashion, as he goes from a<br />
						suede and floral dress attire to rugged vintage<br />
						street wear. The location also pays homage to<br />
						Chicago and his home, the building being a pri-<br />
						mary spot of his father's school of music.

					In this advertisement by Nike, they mysteriously<br />
					feature up and comping brand Cactus Plant Flea<br />
					Market. The visual presents a combination of<br />
					CGI and video of people dressed in CPFM<br />
					doing absurd things. The music conveys a<br />
					whimsical setting and ends in a suspense<br />
					sunset. The creative video marks the introduc-<br />
					tion of a Nike CPFM collaboration on the Va-<br />
					pormax Air Sneaker and other merchandise.
